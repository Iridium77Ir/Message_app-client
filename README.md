# Message_app-client
This is an electron app, which, coupled with my Message_app-server can be used to create a messaging app

I would suggest using "chat.nikober.xyz" in the ip.txt file that you have to create in the app folder before starting it. This will make sure the app uses the message server that I host on my own server.
